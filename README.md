<h1>IMC Calculator Project Summary</h1>
<p>The "IMC Calculator" project is a Python-based calculator for Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a measurement that relates a person's weight and height to assess whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.</p>
<h2>Functionalities</h2>
<p>1. BMI Calculation: It allows users to input their weight and height and returns the calculated BMI value.</p>
<p>2. BMI Classification: Based on the calculated BMI value, the project classifies the result into categories such as "Underweight," "Normal Weight," "Overweight," "Obesity Grade 1," "Obesity Grade 2," or "Obesity Grade 3."</p>
<p>3. Weight Recommendations: In addition to providing BMI classification, the project also provides recommended weight ranges based on the BMI value.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install and run the project, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.</li>
  <li>Clone the project repository to your local environment using the Git command: <code>git clone https://github.com/giuseppeoliveira/IMC-calculator.git</code>.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the project directory: <code>cd IMC-calculator</code>.</li>
  <li>Install the required dependencies using the Python package manager, pip: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</li>
